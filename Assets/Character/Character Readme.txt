This is the final FBX for the version of the character we used in the videos. I'll admit, folks, this entire character was put together VERY quickly. The whole thing, from concept through to a fully textured, rigged, and animated model, had to be done in less than 2 days.I'm certain that all of the animations are doing what they need to do, but please understand that there could still be some considerable polish here and there.

Textures are included in flattened PSD. Feel free to play with them if you like. They're mostly pieced together from skin samples taken from the Advanced Modeling imagery, along with some clothing and fabric images I downloaded from random locations around the Internet. Her climbing harness was literally taken from a pic of an actual harness, copying out each strap and placing them along her body. 

If you need anything, let me know via PM ("Zak" on 3D Buzz) or via email at zak@3dbuzz.com.

PS - If you're looking at her in Maya, please be sure to use 30 frames per second. At 24(film) she has a lot of funny pops and errors in her motion!
